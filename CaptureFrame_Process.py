"""
In this file, you will define your own CaptureFrame_Process funtion. In this function,
you need three arguments: file_path(str type, the video file), sample_frequency(second), save_path(final results saving path).
To do:
	1. Capture the frames for the whole video by your sample_frequency, record the frame number and timestamp(seconds).
	2. Localize and recognize the plates in the frame.(Hints: need to use 'Localization.plate_detection' and 'Recognize.segmetn_and_recognize' functions)
	3. If recognizing any plates, save them into a .csv file.(Hints: may need to use 'pandas' package)
Inputs:(three)
	1. file_path: video path
	2. sample_frequency: second
	3. save_path: final .csv file path
Output: None
